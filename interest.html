					<h2>	<br>Another Dealy </h2>
					<h1>
					<p>Neon Genesis Evangelion is beloved by fans for its compelling characters, psychological drama and philosophical ideas. It's also equally famous for its troubled production, with its television series finale going down in history as one of the most controversial ever.

						The latest and slated to be "final" film in the Evangelion series, Evangelion: 3.0 + 1.0 Thrice Upon a Time, is keeping up that tradition. After years of developmental woes, the film was scheduled to be released on January 23 in Japan. Unfortunately, it has been delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. For the time being, the film no longer has a release date. Fans can be forgiven for feeling like this film is cursed, as this is far from the first delay in this film's troubled production.</p>
